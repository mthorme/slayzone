 *                              byte-identical local vs remote.
 *   SLAYZONE_AGENT_ID        - the mode itself (passed back in the hook envelope)
 *   SLAYZONE_ROOT            - resolved on-disk anchor, set for EVERY spawn (not
 *                              just hook-capable ones): the `slay` CLI inside the

 *                              why the child can no longer derive this itself.
 *   SLAYZONE_AGENT_HOOK_CONTEXT
 *                            - an OPAQUE JSON blob carrying every identity field

 *                              naming any field — so adding a new identity field
 *                              later touches only this function + the server,
 *                              never the shared shell script (the file that rots
 *                              when an older channel clobbers it). Pairs with
 *                              `SLAYZONE_AGENT_HOOK_URL`: same subsystem prefix,
 *                              one says WHERE to post, one says WHO is posting.
 *                              (Renamed from `SLAYZONE_HOOK_CONTEXT`; notify.sh
 *                              still reads the old name as a fallback so an
 *                              older release channel's app can feed a newer
 *                              shared script — see notify.sh v4.)
 *
 * `remote` (a task's pty routed to a runner) only suppresses the loopback hook
 * URL (the runner supplies it). It injects NO hub URL and NO bearer: the hook
 * posts to runner loopback, and the `slay` CLI reaches the hub via its own
 * `cli-hub-target.json` (see apps/cli/hub-config.ts). With no `remote` (the default)
 * nothing about the local env changes.
 *
 * No port/address env var is injected here: the `slay` CLI resolves the local
 * server port from `settings.server_port` in the DB (written by the server at
 * boot). It is NOT inherited — `SLAYZONE_HUB_ADDRESS` is infra-scoped, so
 * sanitizeSpawnEnv strips it at the spawn boundary; the DB is the durable
 * source of truth for every pty.
